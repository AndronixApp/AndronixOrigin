## AndroNix - Linux on Android

Andronix lets you install a Linux system on your Android Device without root. We found out that using Linux on Android is quite useful and lets you do many heavy tasks on your Android device.

  
This app lets you install various popular Linux distributions on your Android device by using Termux and PRoot functionality on the Android system. The application also provides you a graphics layer or Desktop environment (Xfce, MATE, LXDE, LXQt) on the top of the Linux shell which makes the user experience much better than working on a Linux command line.

> AndroNix may or may not work for your device. As Linux is not optimized for Android and there can be zillion hardware combinations devices, thereby making it impossible to debug for each and every device.
